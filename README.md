# STM32-CRC32

Simple calculation for CRC32 for communicating result with STM32 default CRC configuration. When the CRC peripheral on the STM32 is in its default configuration it uses CRC-32/MPEG2, see this [example](https://crccalc.com/?crc=0x00%200x2B%200x02%200xD1%200x3B&method=crc32&datatype=hex&outtype=hex) to compare results with the test program.
